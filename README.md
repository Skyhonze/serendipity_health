A method called Serendipity-Health can effectively raise your awareness of your health and your body's capacity for eating so that you don't overindulge. Send out reminders about the fiber and nutrients your body require.

Specific goals for the SDGs:

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being: The Problem of Malnutrition
   recognizing the need of preserving the body as soon as possible in light of the still-high rates of stunting and malnutrition in Indonesia.


SDG 12: Responsible Production and Consumption: Ethical Treatment of Food Waste
   Since many users are aware of how much food they can fit in their stomachs, they will be more mindful of what they eat and prevent food waste from increasing.

SDG 13 Climate Action: Diminish the Earth's Impact!
   Over several decades, the earth's temperature will gradually drop due to a reduction in food waste, which produces methane gasâ€”the second most harmful gas after greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the vicious cycle of food waste causing crop failure, global warming, and so on will break.
